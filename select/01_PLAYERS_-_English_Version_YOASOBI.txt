Play on! You and me!
Set on the legacy!
Play on! You and me!
Set on the legacy!
Whoo!
Emotions low, my gaze fell down at the day that boots up
Looming on me now, routine rebounds
I know I cannot just nail it, right from the jump
Devotion coated memory's bound
The moment this world was freed by that hero
In my mind, still engraved
And I'm in awe like before
A split second, done
Choose now and seal your fate
Gripping hands, holding tight, full of sweat
The spreading map I'd look on with much care in me
Back when I'd choose to keep on gazing on, for so long
Now retry, now retry
If I could restart
If I could do every part
Now retry, now retry
When we hit the save, it kept our minds as they were at that time
Now retry, now retry
Releasing my grip
On the flip, I've become a grown up
Now retry, now retry
It's all we need, come on
Gotta proceed and type in a new name
Play on! You and me!
Set on the legacy!
Play on! You and me!
Set on the legacy!
Play on! You and me!
Set on the legacy!
Play on! You and me!
Set on the legacy! Yeah
Dream and love, I feel all the hope grow
You've always lit the spark
And you've been teaching me a lot
It all remains in my thoughts
The unfair denotes, when no hope unfolds
You were right by our side
Time and time again, so bold
Overcame it all with might
Now retry, now retry
If I could restart
If I could mend every part
Now retry, now retry
I know I can move up above, and outshine the present
But I know, there's no doubt
Because it is you
Oh, there's no way you'd ever say this
Now retry, now retry
Move on, and choose the continue screen
The one true ending awaits
Now retry, now retry
You're choosing me though I've nothing so great to show
Now retry, now retry
So now, hit the save today and then connect to the new day
Now retry, now retry
The courage imbued as we move 'cause we are the hero
Now retry, now retry
It's all we need, come on
Gotta put all your trust behind this name
Dream and love, I feel all the hope grow
And that call of a joy we know
Is attained with our hands, no doubts
When choosing how the journey's played out
The unfair denotes when no hope unfolds
In all this sorrow untold
If I have you on my mind, I can proceed unconfined
Broke through a path our adventures define
All of this love we held inside
So close, every journey grows
So, continue
Now let's go
